# Tick counter

Project allows you to increment and decrement a counter by pressing 2 different small-tact-10 buttons and show it on a ssd1308 display, these are all connected by a raspberry pico. See pictures beneath to see how it looks in real life.

## Contribution

Code is heavily inspired by raspberry pico start project and ssd1308 rust driver.
